By employing Cloudinary and React, we can use its features to enhance user experience that allows customers to customize products they purchase online in ways of choosing product properties, size, color, delivery means, quantity and other criteria.

Cloudinary is a cloud-based image management and delivery solution that makes developers' life easier by tackling challenges such as:

* __Varying Image Size__: Product images in multiple sizes (thumbnails, main image, hi-res zoom image).

* __Varying Colors__: With Cloudinary, we can change color of the product by computing how much we have to adjust the RGB channels.

* __Custom Texts__: Cloudinary can overlay text and images on top of the shirts.
